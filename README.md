# Twilio Event Streams Integration for Elasticsearch

The Twilio Event Streams integration enables you to collect, monitor and visualize [Twilio Events](https://www.twilio.com/docs/events/event-types) using Elasticsearch.

The integration creates an [HTTP endpoint](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/beats/filebeat/current/filebeat-input-http_endpoint.html), which listens for Twilio events and ingests them into Elasticsearch.

## Setup

**Building the integration** (development only)
- Install the `elastic package`: 
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/elastic/elastic-package.git
    make build
    ```
- Clone this repository.
- Build the integration using the `elastic-package build` command.
- Spin up the Elastic Stack using the `elastic-package stack up -v -d` command. This starts the `package-registry` updated with the newly build integration.

**Enabling the integration**
- In Kibana, navigate to `Management -> Integrations`
- Search for and install the `Twilio Events` integration
- Configure the endpoint address by setting the `Listen Address`, `Listen port` and `Webhook path` variables. It defaults to: `0.0.0.0:8383/twilio/events`.

**Configure Twilio Event Streams to send events to the HTTP endpoint**
- In the Twilio Console navigate to `Event Streams -> Manage`.
- Click on `Create new sink` and create a new [webhook sink](https://www.twilio.com/docs/events/webhook-quickstart). 
- Set the sink destination to the endpoint address created in the previous step.
- Subscribe the sink to events.

That's it! Events will now be pushed to Elasticsearch!
